1. i want you to take the ./copy folder, read, and analyze it use the libs/airtable.js to connect to airtable,

2. and then write a script that creates the tables dynamically and updates them with the data.

3. and then update the copy files from json to js files that gets the data and returns the same structure as the json file so that it would be a seamless integration and update
